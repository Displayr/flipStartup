\usage{
GrowthAccounting(data, volume = FALSE, remove.last = TRUE, tol = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{data.frame} that has variables: \code{id}, \code{period},
and \code{value} (e.g., a \code{RevenueData} object).}

\item{volume}{Weights the results by volume; doesn't currently work.}

\item{remove.last}{Remove the final period (as usually is incomplete).}

\item{tol}{The tolerance used in calculations of differences. This defaults to 1 (e.g., $1).
Values or differences less than this amount are treated as being equivalent. E.g., if revenue for
an entity this period is less than \code{tol} higher than in the previous period, it is treated as being constant.}

\item{...}{Other arguments; not typically required.}
}
\description{
Computes statistics for use in growth accounting of a startup.
}
\details{
Small differences in the percentages shown here versus those computed by other means may occur, due
to: (1) how churn is defined (e.g., the point at time when a customer churns, vs, takes a hieateous); (2) the precision
used to determine whether a subscriber is considered to have contracted/expanded or not.
